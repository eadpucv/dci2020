        <span>In improvisation, there are no mistakes.</span>

    <h2>Call for papers</h2>
    
    <p>A poet stands in the open air and declaims. It is at once about the current situation, and about all situations. It’s about how every act is poetic, in the sense of making, poiesis, and also very local. Design and building are like this at their best. </p>
    
    <p>Design starts from a situation where people, materials, and tools are gathered on a site. Relations between people are complex, mediated through language and body-language. Relations with materials are constrained by what the materials allow, through “affordance”, or as Louis Kahn asked the brick: “What do you want, brick?”. Relations with tools are perhaps the most complex. As Martin Heidegger affirmed, in an example concerning the humble hammer, when we are using it, it is “ready to hand”, meaning that it is simply an extension of our bodies, our arms. But imagine that the head flies off and it becomes unusable: suddenly it is “present-at-hand”, a mere object of no use, intruding on our consciousness. </p>
